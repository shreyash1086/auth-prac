# Project Overview

Welcome to this project!

This application demonstrates user authentication using OTP (One-Time Password) verification via both phone and email. The project leverages Twilio's API to send OTPs to recipient phone numbers and uses NodeMailer to dispatch OTP emails to recipient email addresses.

Through this project, I have practiced integrating third-party services to implement secure and reliable OTP-based authentication for a full-stack application.
